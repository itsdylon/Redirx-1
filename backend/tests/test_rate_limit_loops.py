"""
Crawl-limiter pool ownership across event loops, against real Postgres.

backend/services/pivot_background.py runs its stages on a dedicated thread with
its own event loop, alongside the worker's matching loop, and opens a fresh loop
per asyncio.run() cycle in run_once() — the same shape as the legacy Flask async
path. The limiter's psycopg pool is loop-bound, so those are the conditions the
module-global pool and the module-global asyncio.Lock were never written for.

What must hold no matter how the loops are arranged:

  * the token total for a host is the bucket's, not each loop's — authority is
    the single host_buckets row from migration 025;
  * a loop that loses the race to open the pool still gets an answer, whether
    that is a token or the documented fail-open;
  * a loop that ends gives its connections back.

Buckets here are frozen (refill_rate ~= 0) so a host's *lifetime* token total is
exactly its capacity, which makes "did more tokens come out than the bucket ever
held" a direct assertion rather than a timing estimate.

Requires PREFLIGHT_TEST_DATABASE_URL pointing at a disposable loopback cluster.
Like the other native fixtures this creates its own database on that cluster and
drops it afterwards, so the supplied catalog is never written to; only migration
025 is applied.
