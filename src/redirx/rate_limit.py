"""
Global per-host crawl politeness.

Concurrency limits were per-worker asyncio semaphores, so N workers each doing
a "polite" rate produced N times that rate at the origin — which is why real
sites already 429 us. This limiter is shared state in Postgres, so the rate is
global across every worker and the API.

Postgres rather than Redis deliberately: the limiter caps at ~1 req/s per host,
so sub-millisecond op latency buys nothing, and a second stateful service would
be a second source of truth to monitor. Revisit only above a few hundred
limiter ops/sec.

State lives in host_buckets and is manipulated only through the functions in
migration 025, each of which is a single atomic statement (lazy refill from
elapsed wall-clock time, so there is no background job and no drift).

Transport is direct async Postgres rather than PostgREST: lower latency, and
it keeps the limiter functions off the public REST surface entirely.

Connection note: point CRAWL_LIMITER_DATABASE_URL at the Supabase transaction
pooler (port 6543) so scaling workers cannot exhaust connections. Transaction
mode is safe here because these calls rely only on ON CONFLICT row locks,
which are transaction-scoped — the limiter never takes a session-scoped
advisory lock (which silently does nothing in transaction mode).

The psycopg pool is owned by the event loop that opened it, not by the process
— see the ownership note above _pools. Tokens are not: they are the host's row
in Postgres, shared by every loop, thread and process alike.

# (backend/services/pivot_background.py), and a fresh loop per asyncio.run()
# cycle on the legacy Flask async path. One module-global pool was therefore
# shared by loops that cannot safely share it.
#
# The single module-global asyncio.Lock was the sharper edge: it is not a

# there; loop A's release() resolves that future from the wrong thread without
