"""
SSRF-hardened fetching primitives.

Every server-side fetch of a user-supplied URL (domain discovery, the demo
site auditor, pipeline scraping) must go through a session built with
create_safe_connector(). The guarantees:

- DNS resolution and validation happen at connect time: the connector opens
  connections only to the exact IPs the validating resolver returned, so a
  hostname cannot resolve to a public IP for the check and a private IP for
  the connection (DNS rebinding).
- Redirect hops go through the same connector, so a public domain that 302s
  to an internal address fails at the connect step for that hop.
- Denied ranges: RFC1918, loopback, link-local (incl. cloud metadata
  169.254.169.254), unique-local IPv6, reserved/unspecified/multicast,
  0.0.0.0/8, and any operator-supplied CIDRs (SSRF_DENY_CIDRS env var).

validate_public_url() adds the string-level rules (http/https only, ports
80/443 only) that the resolver cannot see.
