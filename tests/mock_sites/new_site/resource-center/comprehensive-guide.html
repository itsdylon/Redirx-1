                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Enterprise software implementations fail at alarming rates—industry studies suggest 50-70% don't meet their objectives. Common causes include unclear requirements, poor change management, inadequate testing, and lack of executive sponsorship.</p>
                <p>This guide delivers practical frameworks and templates based on hundreds of successful implementations. Follow these proven practices to increase your odds of success dramatically.</p>

                <h2>Requirements Gathering</h2>
                <p>Clear requirements are foundational to success. Conduct stakeholder interviews across all affected departments. Document current-state processes and desired future-state. Create detailed user stories with acceptance criteria. Prioritize requirements using MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have).</p>
                <p>Common mistakes: assuming everyone wants the same thing, documenting what rather than why, failing to validate requirements with end users, scope creep from poor requirements management.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Change Management</h2>
                <p>Technology implementations fail due to people issues more than technical problems. Develop complete change management plans addressing communication, training, and resistance. Identify change champions in each department. Communicate early, often, and transparently about what's changing and why.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Data Migration</h2>
                <p>Data migration is often underestimated. Plan data cleansing, transformation, and validation carefully. Create detailed mapping between source and target systems. Perform multiple test migrations before go-live. Establish data quality metrics and acceptance criteria.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Testing Strategy</h2>
                <p>Comprehensive testing prevents production issues. Execute unit testing, integration testing, user acceptance testing, and performance testing. Involve end users in UAT. Test realistic scenarios with production-like data volumes. Document all defects and track to resolution.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Training & Support</h2>
                <p>User adoption determines implementation success. Develop role-based training programs. Create job aids and quick reference guides. Establish support processes for post-go-live. Plan for super users who can support their departments.</p>
