                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>Acme Corp, a leading retail organization with over 500 stores across North America, was struggling with outdated legacy systems that hindered their sales team's effectiveness. Their existing CRM was built on 15-year-old technology that couldn't keep pace with modern business requirements.</p>

                <p>Key challenges included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sales representatives spending 3-4 hours daily on manual data entry instead of selling</li>
                    <li>Lack of mobile access forcing reps to return to office to update customer information</li>
                    <li>No integration between CRM and other business systems, creating data silos</li>
                    <li>Poor reporting capabilities making it difficult to track sales performance and forecast accurately</li>
                    <li>Customer complaints about inconsistent service due to incomplete customer history</li>
                    <li>High maintenance costs for the aging system with frequent outages</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The company needed a modern solution that would improve sales productivity, enhance customer experiences, and provide better visibility into sales operations.</p>

            <section class="solution">
                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>TechCo Solutions partnered with Acme Corp to design and implement a comprehensive custom CRM solution tailored to their specific business processes and requirements. Our approach combined industry best practices with Acme's unique workflows.</p>

                <h3>Discovery & Planning</h3>
                <p>We began with an intensive 6-week discovery phase, interviewing sales representatives, managers, and executives to understand their workflows, pain points, and requirements. We documented over 200 user stories and created detailed process maps showing how sales activities would flow through the new system.</p>

                <h3>Technical Architecture</h3>
                <p>We designed a cloud-native architecture built on AWS to ensure scalability, reliability, and security:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>React-based web application for desktop users</li>
                    <li>Native mobile apps for iOS and Android with offline capabilities</li>
                    <li>RESTful APIs enabling integration with existing systems</li>
                    <li>PostgreSQL database with automated backups and disaster recovery</li>
                    <li>Microservices architecture allowing independent scaling of components</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Features</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>360-degree customer view consolidating data from multiple sources</li>
                    <li>Automated data capture reducing manual entry by 80%</li>
                    <li>AI-powered lead scoring and opportunity prioritization</li>
                    <li>Real-time sales dashboards and customizable reports</li>
                    <li>Integration with email, calendar, and marketing automation systems</li>
                    <li>Mobile-first design enabling field sales productivity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Implementation Approach</h3>
                <p>We used an agile methodology with 2-week sprints, delivering working software incrementally and incorporating feedback continuously. This approach allowed Acme to see progress regularly and make course corrections as needed.</p>
