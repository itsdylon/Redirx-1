                <h2>Services & Capabilities</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What technologies do you specialize in?</h3>
                    <p>Our team has expertise across a broad technology stack including Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, .NET, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), mobile development (iOS, Android, React Native), and modern frameworks (React, Angular, Vue.js, Spring Boot). We stay current with emerging technologies and can adapt to your preferred tech stack.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can you maintain existing applications or only build new ones?</h3>
                    <p>We provide both new development and maintenance services. Many of our clients engage us to enhance, modernize, or support their existing applications. We're experienced at working with legacy codebases and can help you gradually modernize systems while maintaining business continuity.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you provide ongoing support after project completion?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, we offer comprehensive support and maintenance services. All fixed-price projects include a post-deployment support period. We can also establish ongoing support agreements with defined service level agreements (SLAs) for production systems.</p>

                <h2>Process & Timeline</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How long does a typical project take?</h3>
                    <p>Project timelines vary significantly based on scope and complexity. A simple web application might take 8-12 weeks, while a complex enterprise system could require 6-12 months or more. During our initial consultation, we'll provide a realistic timeline estimate based on your specific requirements.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is your development methodology?</h3>
                    <p>We primarily use Agile methodologies, specifically Scrum and Kanban, which allow for iterative development, regular feedback, and flexibility to adapt to changing requirements. We work in sprints (typically 2 weeks) with regular demos and opportunities for course correction.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How involved will we need to be during the project?</h3>
                    <p>We believe successful projects require active client participation. We'll need your involvement for requirements clarification, design approvals, sprint demos, and user acceptance testing. Typically, clients dedicate a product owner or project sponsor who commits 5-10 hours per week, with additional team members involved as needed for specific decisions.</p>

                <h2>Pricing & Contracts</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do you price your services?</h3>
                    <p>We offer multiple pricing models including time & materials (hourly rates), fixed price projects, and dedicated team retainers. The best model depends on your project characteristics, budget constraints, and risk tolerance. See our <a href="/pricing.html">pricing page</a> for more details.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What payment terms do you offer?</h3>
                    <p>For fixed-price projects, we typically structure payments around milestones (e.g., 25% upfront, 50% at key milestones, 25% upon completion). For time & materials engagements, we bill monthly in arrears. We're flexible and can discuss payment structures that work for your organization.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do you require long-term contracts?</h3>
                    <p>No, we don't require long-term commitments for most engagements. Time & materials contracts can be terminated with 30 days notice. Fixed-price projects have defined end dates. Dedicated team engagements typically have 3-6 month initial terms, after which they can be renewed monthly.</p>
