                <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
                <p>Cloud migration represents one of the most significant technology initiatives organizations undertake. Done well, cloud migration reduces costs, improves agility, and enables innovation. Done poorly, it creates disruption, cost overruns, and technical debt.</p>
                <p>This whitepaper distills lessons from hundreds of cloud migration projects across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. We share proven strategies for planning, executing, and optimizing cloud migrations that deliver expected business value.</p>

                <h2>Building the Business Case</h2>
                <p>Successful cloud migrations start with clear business objectives. Common drivers include cost reduction, improved scalability, faster innovation, enhanced disaster recovery, and enabling global expansion. Quantify expected benefits and establish metrics to track progress.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total cost of ownership analysis comparing current state to cloud scenarios</li>
                    <li>Risk assessment identifying potential issues and mitigation strategies</li>
                    <li>Timeline estimation based on application portfolio complexity</li>
                    <li>Resource requirements including team skills and external support needs</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>Assessment & Planning</h2>
                <p>Thorough assessment prevents costly surprises during migration. Inventory all applications, dependencies, and infrastructure. Categorize applications using the 7 Rs framework: Rehost, Replatform, Repurchase, Refactor, Retire, Retain, Relocate.</p>
                <p>Plan migration waves grouping related applications. Consider dependencies, complexity, and business criticality when sequencing. Early waves should include low-risk applications to build team confidence and refine processes.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Execution Best Practices</h2>
                <p>Successful execution requires detailed planning, thorough testing, and careful change management. Use automated migration tools where possible. Maintain parallel environments during transition. Document everything including runbooks, architecture decisions, and lessons learned.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Post-Migration Optimization</h2>
                <p>Migration is just the beginning. Optimize resource sizing, implement cost monitoring, leverage cloud-native services, and establish governance. Many organizations achieve additional 20-30% cost savings through post-migration optimization.</p>
